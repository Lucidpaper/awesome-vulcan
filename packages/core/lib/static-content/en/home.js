export default `# Awesome Vulcan

This application is an _awesome_ demo of the equally _awesome_ JavaScript framework [Vulcan.js](http://vulcanjs.org/). The functionnalities are fairly limited for the moment, however the underlying code has been built with reusability in mind.

It could serve as basis or an inspiration for your own application, especially if you want to build an admin dashboard, an item catalog or any other kind of backoffice application. Thus, it gave birth to a few generic packages:

- [vulcan-backoffice-builder](https://github.com/lbke/vulcan-backoffice-builder): helpers to quickly generate administration pages
- [vulcan-users-manager](https://github.com/lbke/vulcan-users-manager): users creation and administration
- [vulcan-menu](https://github.com/lbke/vulcan-menu): menu items global registration, to allow package based navigation management
- [vulcan-validation-workflows](https://github.com/lbke/vulcan-validation-workflows): allow to setup document moderation workflows

You can propose real Vulcan related resources here, like your own packages or articles, or test the form with fake data. Of course, only valid submissions will be made public.
